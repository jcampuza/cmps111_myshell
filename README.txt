cmps111 assignment 1 myshell

In this assignment a simple shell is made for the freeBSD operating system.

I have it set to where > will simply replace the contents of the file
instead of throwing an error, as this more closely emulates what actual
shells do. I felt it would be more consistent to try to emulate popular
shells

KNOWN BUGS

Occasionally when using pipes, the prompt message will go away/dissapear
or appear in the output of some commands
